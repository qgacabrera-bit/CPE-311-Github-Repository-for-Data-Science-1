        "The recursive approach calculates the factorial by having the function call itself with smaller numbers until it reaches 0. For example, factorial(4) calls factorial(3), factorial(2), and so on, then multiplies the results on the way back. This method is simple and easy to understand but can be slow and use a lot of memory for large numbers. The dynamic programming approach, on the other hand, uses a table to store the factorials of all numbers from 0 to n and calculates them one by one. This way, each factorial is calculated only once, making it faster and safer for large numbers. In short, recursion is simple but less efficient, while dynamic programming is more efficient and avoids repeated work."

It doesn’t use recursion and is usually faster for large numbers. In short, top-down goes from big to small with recursion, while bottom-up goes from small to big with a loop.</p>"

Analyzing each one and making my own code using them, it is clear that each method has its advantages. Recursion is simple and easy to understand but becomes slow for larger problems. Dynamic programming is the fastest and most reliable because it avoids repeated calculations, while memoization offers a good balance by keeping recursion readable and improving performance. Overall, dynamic programming is the best choice for solving the Knapsack Problem or similar ones efficiently, but recursion and memoization are useful for learning and moderate-sized problems."
